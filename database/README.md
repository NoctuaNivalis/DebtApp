Database implementation
=======================

This Android app uses a MySQL database to store the debts.   
Make a file in this directory named database.properties in which you save your username, password and the link to your database.  
e.g.:   

    url = jdbc:mysql://servername3306/debtdb?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull
    
    driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  
    user = debtdbuser
  
    password = XXXXXXXXX
